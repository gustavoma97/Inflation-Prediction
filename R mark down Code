# Forecast I: INPC (National Consumer Price Index)

The first series explored is the annualized monthly inflation rate. The observed data is monthly and represents the percentage change compared to the value of the INPC from the previous year in the same month. For example, the observed data for October 2021 is calculated as follows.

$$Inflation\% = \frac{INPC_{Oct-2021} - INPC_{Oct-2020}}{INPC_{Oct-2020}}*100$$

Two different series are worked with. Both start in January 2008; the first is used to adjust the model and the last observation it contains is in September 2021. Once the corresponding ARIMA model is adjusted, a one-step forecast will be made on the updated series up to October 2021, so our forecast will be about inflation in November of the same year.

## Series Description

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(ts_inpc)
```

In the graph you can observe a couple of interesting characteristics that reflect the economic environment of the country.

To start, we see that from the fourth quarter of 2008 to before the last quarter of 2009, high inflation rates were observed reflecting the impact of the global mortgage crisis; then, stable years are observed, although above the Bank of Mexico's 3% target, until the beginning of 2015, and throughout 2016, in which it remains, except for the last months of this last year, at levels even below 3%. This is mainly explained by the economic conditions of that year, such as the reduction in the price of raw materials (mainly energy) perhaps as a result of structural reforms in the telecommunications and energy sectors together with a lack of important depreciation of the currency.

At the end of 2016, the rise in the cost of processed food goods and depreciation in the exchange rate begins, the price of gasoline also increases in the northern border of the country along with some energy and agricultural products that explain the upward trend of the inflationary index. These conditions persist throughout 2017, returning to high levels of inflation.

To counter these effects, in 2018 a monetary policy is introduced on the increase in the target interest rate. Combined with the fading of the effects of the previous year, these levels decrease again with some periods of increases, potentially seasonal, until a sharp decrease in 2020 together with an aggressive increase in 2021. These two movements are due to changes in consumption patterns, economic and social crises, as well as increases and decreases in prices, all caused by the global pandemic.

This trend continues to rise and, as will be seen in our forecast, even higher levels (above 7%) are expected in the last months of 2021.

## ANALYSIS

Decomposing the series, we see that there is no significant difference in its decomposition assuming an additive model compared to assuming a multiplicative one. For this reason, we work with the simplest (the additive) and later use this fact to deseasonalize it and examine its ARIMA structure.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(decompose(ts_inpc))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(decompose(ts_inpc,type = "multiplicative"))
```

The monthly data reflects a periodicity that is worth exploring.

In the two graphs shown below, it is observed that around the months of July and August the highest inflation levels are presented, May usually has low levels although in general the trend per month rises until the third of the year again in the last months of the year with a slight increase in the last month.

This tells us about a consumption pattern in economic activity that is consistent with the periodic behavior of active agents in the Mexican economy throughout the year.

```{r}
plot.ts(decompose(ts_inpc)$seasonal[1:12])
```



```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggsubseriesplot(ts_inpc)
```


### Stationarity analysis

Reviewing the autocorrelation and partial correlation functions, it is thought that the model follows an MA(1) process in its seasonal component. It is assumed that this component is stationary. The X13-ARIMA process will fit a good candidate that will help us to verify this assumption.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
acf(ts_inpc, main = "Inflation ACF")
pacf(ts_inpc, main = "Inflation PACF")
```


For the non-seasonal part of the model, the Dickey-Fuller test is used to reject or not the existence of a unit root.


```{r,echo=FALSE}
desest <- ts_inpc-decompose(ts_inpc)$seas
adf.desest <- ur.df(desest, type="trend")
summary(adf.desest)
```


Now, the seasonal part in first difference.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
summary(ur.df(diff(desest), type="trend"))
```


The values obtained from the tests dictate that the non-seasonal part of the model is an order 1 integrated model.

## MODEL FITTING

### Model Selection

Applying the X13-ARIMA method, the fitted model is an ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,0,1). As expected, the seasonal part is represented by a first degree moving average.

The non-seasonal part is somewhat uncertain and to address this we compare the following 8 models using the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian criterion.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide'}
m1 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(1,1,0),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
m2 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(0,1,1),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
m3 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(1,1,1),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
m4 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(2,1,0),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
m5 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(2,1,1),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
m6 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(2,1,2),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
m7 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(0,1,2),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
m8 <- arima(ts_inpc, order = c(1,1,2),seasonal = c(0,0,1) ,method = "ML")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
dfr <- data.frame("Model" = c("ARIMA(1,1,0)(0,0,1)","ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(2,1,0)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(2,1,1)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(2,1,2)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(0,1,2)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(1,2,2)(0,0,1)"),
                  "AIC" = c(m1$aic,m2$aic,m3$aic,m4$aic,m5$aic,m6$aic,m7$aic,m8$aic),
                  "BIC" = BIC(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8)
)
dfr
```

From the presented table, we stay with the first two models as candidates for the selected fitting model and, in consistency with the choice of X13-ARIMA, we will work on forecasting with the ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,0,1).

With the Diebold and Mariano test, it is concluded that it is statistically equal to forecast with the first model as with the second and then, coinciding in results with the automated method, we proceed to forecast.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
dm.test(residuals(m1),residuals(m2),alternative = c("two.sided"))
```



### Model fitting via X13


```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(seas(
x = ts_inpc,
x11 = ""
))
```

As can be seen, the red line (adjusted series) and the black line (original series) match quite well.

## FORECAST

The automated method calculates the "projected" value of inflation for October 2021, along with its lower and upper limits respectively.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
s <- seas(
x = ts_inpc,
forecast.save = "fct",
x11 = ""
)

s$series$fct[1,1:3]

```

Now, we know that the actual value in that month is 6.24. In that sense, the model is underestimating our estimate. This could be due to recent low levels of inflation caused by the pandemic shock. An idea to counteract this possible effect would be to throw a punctual forecast that results from averaging the estimated value of the model with the upper forecasted limit of the same.

To convince ourselves a little more of this phenomenon, let's see the punctual forecasts for the month of October that are provided by the other seven models considered earlier...

```{r,echo=FALSE}
dfr1 <- data.frame("Model" = c("ARIMA(1,1,0)(0,0,1)","ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(2,1,0)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(2,1,1)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(2,1,2)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(0,1,2)(0,0,1)" ,"ARIMA(1,2,2)(0,0,1)"),
                  "October 2021 forecast" = c(
  predict(m1)$pred%>% as.numeric(),
  predict(m3)$pred%>% as.numeric(),
  predict(m4)$pred%>% as.numeric(),
  predict(m5)$pred%>% as.numeric(),
  predict(m6)$pred%>% as.numeric(),
  predict(m7)$pred%>% as.numeric(),
  predict(m8)$pred%>% as.numeric()
)
)
dfr1
```

As you can see, all the models underestimate the value of 6.24.

If we "correct" this underestimation, the idea would be to calculate the average between 6.016425 and 6.452620 obtained from X13. In that case our final forecast would be

```{r,echo=FALSE}
mean(c(6.016425,6.452620 ))
```
Which is much closer to the observed value.

###Forecast for November 2021
Using all the information obtained, the model is adjusted to the updated series and forecasted with the same idea. The results for November's inflation from the model are as follows.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p <- seas(
x = ts_act,
x11 = "",
forecast.save = "fct"
)
p$series$fct[1,1:3]
```


Therefore, our final inclination for the inflation forecast in November 2021 is
```{r,echo=FALSE}
mean(c(7.031281,7.467432 ))
```
